Workday Scheduler

Installation:
    Open index.html file. You'll find the javascript and css sheets in the Develop folder.


Usage:
The goal was to create a functioning wordday schdeuler. The requirements were for the time to display correctly on the screen and that the time blocks were color coordinated according to past, present, or future events. The time blocks also had to be editable and be able to store those events locally so that if you refreshed the page the events would still stay on the page.
